# LongestPathDAG
 Given a DAG and a vertex, calculate the longest directed path from that vertexs.

### Complexity
   Time Complexity: Time complexity of topological sorting is O(V+E). After finding topological order, the algorithm process all vertices and for every vertex, it runs a loop for all adjacent vertices. Total adjacent vertices in a graph is O(E). So the inner loop runs O(V+E) times. Therefore, overall time complexity of this algorithm is O(V+E).

   Space complexity : O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. 

### Conclusion
 As you can see my code is based on DFS(Depth First Search) algorithm, it is linear time. I think it is a very optimized code.
So My solution works well for larger graphs also.
If you wanna add the weight of the edge, we can extend the code also simply.


## Q & A

### What are some things you donâ€™t like about Java?
   You know, Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language and I have over 6 years of experience in Java.
I like this language but there are some disadvantages.
   I have implemented numerous projects with more than 6 years of Java development experience. It's very powerful, but it has disadvantages.
   1. Verbosity: Java can be verbose, which means that it requires more code to accomplish the same task compared to other programming languages. This verbosity can make the code harder to read and understand.
   2. Performance: Java can be slower than other programming languages, especially when it comes to startup time and memory usage. This can be a problem for certain types of applications that require high performance or real-time responsiveness.
   3. Null Pointer Exception: Java allows null values, which can lead to the infamous Null Pointer Exception (NPE) runtime errors that are difficult to debug.
   4. Versioning: Java's versioning system can be confusing, with different versions having different features and capabilities. This can make it difficult to know which version of Java to use for a particular project.
   5. Security: Java has had some security vulnerabilities in the past, which has caused concerns among developers and users.
   6. Build system: Java's build system, Maven, can be complex and difficult to use for beginners, compared to other build systems.

#### If you could choose any language/framework/technology stack, what would you choose and why?

My main language is JavaScript with over 10 years of experience.
You know, Javascript is a very popular & powerful language.
So I'm familiar with these frameworks & libraries like React, Angular, Node, Express.js, etc.
And then My preferred stacks for web development are the MERN/MEAN stack, which consists of MongoDB, Express.js, React/AngularJS, and Node.js. MongoDB is a NoSQL database, which provides flexibility and scalability. Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js, which simplifies the process of building web applications. React/AngularJS is a front-end JavaScript framework that provides a robust set of tools for building dynamic web applications. Finally, Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run server-side JavaScript code. The MERN/MEAN stack provides a complete end-to-end solution for building modern web applications.

It's difficult to compare JavaScript and Java directly, as they are both powerful programming languages with their own unique strengths and weaknesses. However, here are some advantages of JavaScript over Java: Lightweight, Large developer community, Easy to learn, Compatibility:
JavaScript is a powerful programming language that is ideal for front-end web development, has a large and active developer community, is lightweight and easy to learn, and is compatible with all modern web browsers. While both JavaScript and Java have their own unique strengths and weaknesses, JavaScript may be a better choice for certain types of web development projects.

In summary, the choice of technology stack largely depends on the specific requirements of the project, such as scalability, performance, and the desired features. It's important to choose a technology stack that is appropriate for the project and provides the necessary features and capabilities to meet the project requirements.
